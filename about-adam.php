		<p>There have been a lot of experiences and some people that have influenced me through-out my life. I am
			currently a full-time student at Central New Mexico Community College in Albuquerque, NM, which is where I grew up.
			This is my first year continuing my education since high school, mostly because I was no satisfied with my routine and
			employment situation, so I thought this would help me get out of that mindset and get a fresh perspective. As the third
			of four siblings, my older brother has been a positive influence, along with a few other mentors I have been fortunate
			to meet through-out my life. I have always been a curious and inquisative person, that is OK with doing things out of
			the "norm". This mindset has allowed me to experience life in different ways but has also been a distraction in
			accomplishing my long-term goals. With that, I plan on taking that same mindset but with a more responsible approach
			and accomplish my "Hopes and Dreams"<</p>
